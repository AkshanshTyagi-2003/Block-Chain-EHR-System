# BlockCare EHR â€“ Decentralized Electronic Health Record System

**BlockCare EHR** is a secure, decentralized web application for managing electronic health records using blockchain technology. It ensures that medical data is tamper-proof, access-controlled, and transparently shared only with verified healthcare providers. The application uses **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS** on the frontend, and integrates **Ethereum smart contracts** for identity verification and access control.

## Features

- **Blockchain-Based Doctor Verification**
  - Doctors are validated on-chain to ensure trust and authenticity.
- **Decentralized Health Record Access**
  - Patients have full control over who accesses their records.
- **Tamper-Proof Medical Records**
  - Every record update is stored immutably via smart contracts.
- **Responsive UI**
  - Modern, clean interface built with React.js and Tailwind CSS.
- **Off-chain Data Storage (Optional)**
  - Medical files can be stored on IPFS with hash mapping on-chain.
